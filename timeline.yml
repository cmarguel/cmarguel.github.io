          The start of the saga. If you see a node like this, it means important plot 
          threads have converged here, and you can hover over them (or tap, if you're on mobile) 
          to get a quick overview of what points from each thread you might need to know--in case 
          you forgot, or skipped a few chapters. These nodes will have spoilers for preceding
          chapters!
